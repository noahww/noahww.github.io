    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am Noah Wright, a recent college graduate from Clemson University with a Bachelor's
      in Computer Science. I graduated with general honors and used my elective
      to focus primarily on security and machine learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      My most recent position was as an intern in the Cyber Security Operations
      Center at Clemson University. As a whole, the CSOC monitors suspicious
      activity on the Clemson network, protecting the students and employees
      from various types of attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I started at the CSOC I spent a couple of summers as a web
      developer for an industry mentor from my high school cyber defense club.
      Through my work in this field I got comfortable working with React.js,
      Redux.js, and D3.js, and Javascript.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not working or studying, I enjoy playing video games and writing
      music.
